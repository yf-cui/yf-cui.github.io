== About
I'm working as a postdoc researcher in [https://mlab.hk MLab] directed by Prof. Ted-Wei Kuo, Prof. Chun Jason Xue and Dr. Nan Guan, CityU HK. I also work closely with [http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk VISAL] directed by Prof. Antoni B. Chan. Prior to that, I obtained my PhD in computer science in CityU HK, MS in Telecommunications in HKUST and BE in Shandong University.

I also lead the AI research lab in [https://www.ibingli.cn/ Bingli Tech], Guangzhou.

My research interests include 
. Probabilistic deep learning with applications in:
	.. Medical images and Histopathology.
	.. Light-weight neural network and embedded AI.
	.. Data engineering - data compression and learned index.
. Storage - optimization for flash reliability.
