== About
I'm working as a postdoc in McGill University and MILA, advised by [https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html, Prof. Xue Liu].

I am an advisor of the medical AI research lab in [https://www.ibingli.cn/ Bingli Tech], Guangzhou.

I worked as a postdoc from July, 2021 to June 2022, in [https://mlab.hk MLab], CityU HK. Prior to that, I obtained my PhD degree in CityU HK, advised by [https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jasonxue/ Prof. Chun Jason Xue], [https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/ Prof. Antoni B. Chan] and [https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~ktw/ Prof. Tei-Wei Kuo]. I obtained MS degree in Telecommunications in HKUST and BE in Communication Engineering in Shandong University.

My research interests include 
. Probabilistic deep learning with applications in:
	.. Medical images and Histopathology.
	.. Light-weight neural network and embedded AI.
	.. Data engineering - data compression and learned index.
. Storage - optimization for flash reliability.
